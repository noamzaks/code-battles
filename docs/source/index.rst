Welcome to Code Battles's documentation!
========================================

**Code Battles** is a `React <https://react.dev/>`_ + `PyScript <https://pyscript.net/>`_ library for creating interactive competitive coding battles.

A battles event consist of teams, which work on their bots for a game you implement (such as Bloons TD Battles, Snake or anything you else can imagine).
This library enables you to create such an activity **without** having to do any web development.
You only need to implement the simulation logic, API definition and implementation, and renderer of your specific game.
